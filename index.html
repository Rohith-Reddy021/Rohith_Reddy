    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>Albert Einstein, one of the most renowned physicists in history, was born on March 14, 1879, in Ulm,
    Germany. He is best known for developing the theory of relativity, a revolutionary framework that describes 
    the intricate relationship between mass and energy, fundamentally altering our understanding of space, 
    time, and the nature of the universe. His groundbreaking work not only reshaped theoretical physics but 
    also paved the way for advancements in technology, influencing fields ranging from cosmology to nuclear energy. 
    In 1921, Einstein was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics for his explanation of the photoelectric effect, a discovery 
    that played a pivotal role in the development of quantum theory and furthered our understanding of light and matter interactions. 
    Beyond his remarkable scientific achievements, Einstein was also a passionate advocate for peace, civil rights, and intellectual 
    freedom, using his platform to speak out against war and injustice. His insatiable curiosity, boundless creativity, and profound belief 
    in the power of imagination continue to inspire generations of scientists, thinkers, and activists around the world, reminding us of 
    the importance of inquiry and the quest for knowledge in our lives.</p>
    <p>Albert Einstein's papers, particularly those published in the early 20th century, 
    are pivotal to the foundation of modern physics. His 1905 papers, often referred to 
    as his "Annus Mirabilis" or "Miracle Year," introduced groundbreaking concepts, including 
    the theory of special relativity, the photoelectric effect, and Brownian motion. Among these, 
    the paper on special relativity fundamentally altered the understanding of time and space, 
    while the one on the photoelectric effect provided key evidence for the quantum theory of 
    light, earning him the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1921. In 1915, his paper on general relativity 
    expanded these ideas, presenting gravity as a curvature of spacetime caused by mass. Each of 
    these works not only challenged existing scientific paradigms but also opened new avenues for 
    research, cementing Einstein's status as one of the foremost scientists of his time and profoundly 
    influencing the course of physics.</p>
